				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_9' n='N009'/>Iris Films was begun in the spring of 1975 out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_10' n='N010'/>desire to produce and distribute films that spoke to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_11' n='N011'/>women in a way that the products of Hollywood do
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_12' n='N012'/>not. We saw ourselves as part of the movement of
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_13' n='N013'/>women to regain, define, and create our own culture
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_14' n='N014'/>In the fall of 1975 we were actively looking for films
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_15' n='N015'/>by other women to distribute, and were deciding to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_16' n='N016'/>begin our own first production, a film defending the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_17' n='N017'/>right of lesbian mothers to maintain custody of their
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_18' n='N018'/>children. We began interviewing dozens of lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_19' n='N019'/>mothers with cassette recorder, not only hearing thein
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_20' n='N020'/>stories, but also sharing our own experiences as les¬
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_21' n='N021'/>bians. One of the three of us is also a mother, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_22' n='N022'/>other two of us are very committed to children as an
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_23' n='N023'/>integral part of our movement and community.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_24' n='N024'/>Our original plan was to make something that would
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_25' n='N025'/>appeal directly to those people who have the most
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_26' n='N026'/>power over a lesbian in a child custody situation: the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_27' n='N027'/>judges, the probation officers, the attorneys, the social
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_28' n='N028'/>workers. As we talked more and more with different
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_29' n='N029'/>lesbian mothers and heard their stories, that conception
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_30' n='N030'/>began to change. We realized, with them, that what
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_31' n='N031'/>they had to say was important for the general public,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_32' n='N032'/>for other lesbians and their children, and for the wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_33' n='N033'/>en’s movement to hear. We began to broaden our image
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_34' n='N034'/>of the film and of who the audience would be, and to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_35' n='N035'/>consider what compromises we would and would not
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_36' n='N036'/>make in order to make our statements. We knew that a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_37' n='N037'/>film for judges and probation officers would have to be
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_38' n='N038'/>very low key and very liberal and that we would have
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_39' n='N039'/>to present very “acceptable” lesbians (in terms of their
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_40' n='N040'/>image, lifestyle, and statements)—the more middle
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_41' n='N041'/>class, and accepting of American, white, capitalist
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_42' n='N042'/>values, the better. We decided most adamantly that we
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_43' n='N043'/>didn’t want to do that with the women that we had met
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_44' n='N044'/>who had become our friends. We found (not sur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_45' n='N045'/>prisingly) that the women who had the strongest state¬
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_46' n='N046'/>ments to make about being lesbian mothers were not
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_47' n='N047'/>those who would be the most palatable to the &quot;up-
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_48' n='N048'/>holders of justice” in this country, since these women
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_49' n='N049'/>understood their oppression as lesbians to include the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_50' n='N050'/>’upholders.&quot; They were not saying, “We just want to be

				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_1_2' n='N001'/>like everyone else, so please be good to us.&quot; They were
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_2_2' n='N002'/>saying, “We’re happy, and we’re healthy, and we’re
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_3_2' n='N003'/>proud, and we’re tired of being fucked over.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_4_1' n='N004'/>What we finally came up with—in rethinking, retalk-
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_5_1' n='N005'/>ing, reworking our ideas in the months before we
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_6_1' n='N006'/>actually started shooting—was something in between
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_7_1' n='N007'/>the most radical film we could make, and one that the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_8_1' n='N008'/>patriarchial powers could watch and learn from. We
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_9_1' n='N009'/>knew that we were in a position to take more risks than
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_10_1' n='N010'/>any lesbian mother facing a judge in a custody trial, and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>yet, if the film was to serve any useful propagandistic
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_12_1' n='N012'/>purpose for educating judges and the homophobic gen
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_13_1' n='N013'/>eral public, we had to be making statements that such
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>an audience could relate to. What we ended up with
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_15_1' n='N015'/>were a variety of women, situations, and statements
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>that show how lesbian mothers are both the same as,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>and different from other mothers.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>Once we had completed our initial interviews, we
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>chose eight women and their children to be in the film
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>We made these choices based on a number of considera¬
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>tions. We wanted to show a cross-section of women
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_22_1' n='N022'/>based on class and race, on lifestyle, and on the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_23_1' n='N023'/>numbers and ages of their children. We wanted the film
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_24_1' n='N024'/>to show that we were not speaking of only one partic-
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_25_1' n='N025'/>ular type of lesbian, when we spoke of a lesbian’s right
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_26_1' n='N026'/>to keep her children. So we chose from as broad a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_27_1' n='N027'/>spectrum as we could, keeping in mind the specific
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_28_1' n='N028'/>experiences that each woman could speak to in the film.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_29_1' n='N029'/>The three of us had been working together as a collec-
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_30_1' n='N030'/>tive, and we wanted to continue working that way once
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_31_1' n='N031'/>we began production on the film. Two of us were
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_32_1' n='N032'/>experienced filmmakers, and the third, although having
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_33_1' n='N033'/>no film experience, was very good at interviewing
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_34_1' n='N034'/>people. We were committed to the idea of sharing skills
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_35_1' n='N035'/>in our work, and because of this, we decided that each
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_36_1' n='N036'/>of us would be in charge of an area where she felt the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_37_1' n='N037'/>most expertise (the three areas were camera, sound re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_38_1' n='N038'/>cording, and directing/interviewing), but that all of us
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_39_1' n='N039'/>would have an opportunity to work at each of these.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_40_1' n='N040'/>We found that having a well-thought-out common
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_41_1' n='N041'/>vision of what we wanted the film to be, made it
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_42_1' n='N042'/>possible for us to do this. We had other women working
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_43_1' n='N043'/>on the film with us (usually helping with lighting or
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_44_1' n='N044'/>camera assistance), but none of them were involved in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_45_1' n='N045'/>the collective process. They would commit themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_46_1' n='N046'/>to working on the film on a day-to-day basis, as it fit
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_47_1' n='N047'/>into their schedules.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_48_1' n='N048'/>As feminists, we found our priority was to deal with
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_49_1' n='N049'/>the feelings of the women and children we were filming,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_region_1675015703709_1684_tl_50_1' n='N050'/>rather than doing whatever necessary to get what we

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_1' n='N001'/>wanted on film. We would never push to get a shot
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_2' n='N002'/>when we felt there was resistance, or if it seemed too dis
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_3' n='N003'/>ruptive. This, and the mothers’ understanding about the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_4' n='N004'/>need for this film, made them very cooperative and
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_5' n='N005'/>adaptable to our needs. Although it was an unfamiliar
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_6' n='N006'/>situation for most of them, and there was some nervous¬
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_7' n='N007'/>ness, the general feeling when we turned on the cameras
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_8' n='N008'/>was relaxed and open.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_9' n='N009'/>We decided sometime in September that, in addition
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_10' n='N010'/>to filming the children with their mothers, we would
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_11' n='N011'/>like to get the children talking with each other about
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_12' n='N012'/>their common experience. We arranged this with the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_13' n='N013'/>children of three of the mothers from northern Califor¬
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_14' n='N014'/>nia, plus two other children whose mothers were not in
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_15' n='N015'/>the film. There was a lot of energy and excitement from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_16' n='N016'/>the children, because the focus was on them and what
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_17' n='N017'/>they had to say, and because they could talk with peers
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_18' n='N018'/>about their mothers, and could share their feelings and
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_19' n='N019'/>experiences without fear of being put down. Filming the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_20' n='N020'/>children by themselves added a new perspective to the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_21' n='N021'/>film, both in terms of what they had to say, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_22' n='N022'/>openness with which they said it.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_23' n='N023'/>We spent the months from November, 1976, to May,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_24' n='N024'/>1977, editing and fundraising, and when we finally got
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_25' n='N025'/>the necessary money (primarily from three small
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_26' n='N026'/>foundations, from a concert in Los Angeles, and from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_27' n='N027'/>individual donations), we completed the final steps of
				<lb facs='#facs_104_region_1675015727928_1699_tl_28' n='N028'/>recording the music, filming pick-up shots and still
